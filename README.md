## Author: Justin Gong

This project takes player data from 2000-2022 in order to predict the NBA player awards for the 2022-2023 season. This is an end-to-end data science project which involves webscraping raw data from multiple sources to deploying finished models. The project employed the following skills: webscraping, data cleaning, visualization, analysis, preprocessing, model building and testing, hyperparameter tuning, and more. The following models were tested and evaluated:

- Multiple Linear Regression
- LASSO
- Ridge
- Support Vector
- Random Forest
- **Extreme Gradient-Booster Decision Tree (XGBoost)** (Selected model)
