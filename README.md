# NBA Awards Predictor: 2022-2023 Season
## Author: Justin Gong

This project takes player data from 2000-2022 in order to predict the NBA player awards for the 2022-2023 season. This is an end-to-end data science project which involves webscraping raw data from multiple sources to deploying finished models. The project employed the following skills: webscraping, data cleaning, visualization, analysis, preprocessing, model building and testing, hyperparameter tuning, and more. 

## Breakdown of Project Contents 

**data** 
- Contains all the raw webscraped data utilized in the project 
**models**
- Finalized models used during the project, trained with 2000-2022 data (All XGBoost regressors) 
**notebooks**:
- **Part 1**: Converting the raw data into structured datasets and creating new features
- **Part 2**: Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Part 3**: Data preprocessing, model training, and model tuning 
- **Part 4**: Model deployment
**Webscraping.py**
- Code used to retrieve data from online databases
**Project Summary**
- More in-depth summary of process, analysis, and results of the project

The following models were tested:

- Multiple Linear Regression
- LASSO
- Ridge
- Support Vector
- Random Forest
- **Extreme Gradient-Booster Decision Tree (XGBoost)** (Selected model)

### Rookie of the Year

The Rookie of the Year award could not be predicted because I couldn't project 2023 season data without any previous seasons.

## Model Performance for 2021 and 2022 Seasons:

*Note*: 2021 and 2022 were my test sets, however I retrained the model using these two seasons for 2023 season predictions.
